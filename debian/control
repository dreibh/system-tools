Description: Print basic system information and banners
 This program displays basic status information about the system:
 hostname, uptime, CPU, memory statistics, disk space statistics,
 SSH public key hashes, and networking information. Furthermore,
 it can be configured to show one or more banners (for example,
 a project name).
 System-Info can be configured to be automatically run when logging
 in, providing the user an up-to-date overview of the system.

Description: Helper tool to adjust GRUB configuration
 This program adjusts a GRUB configuration file by applying a configuration
 from a template, and merging the existing configurations settings with
 additional customisations. It can for example be used to set a custom
 screen resolution (GRUB_GFXMODE option) or startup tune (GRUB_INIT_TUNE
 option).
 Warning: This program is meant to be used by expert users! Do not modify
 a working GRUB configuration without knowing how to boot the system from
 a rescue media to fix a broken configuration!
